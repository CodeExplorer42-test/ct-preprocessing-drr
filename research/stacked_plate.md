Simulation-Ready Specification for a Dual-Layer, Anti-Crosstalk Flat-Panel Detector for a ±6° Stereo DRR Pipeline on Apple Silicon Metal


1. Detector Architecture & Materials

This section establishes the foundational physical model of the dual-layer flat-panel detector (FPD) system. It provides a comprehensive specification of the materials, dimensions, and radiological properties for each component in the detector stack. This information is essential for the accurate simulation of photon interactions, signal generation, and noise propagation within the forward-projection pipeline. The architecture has been optimized to balance the competing requirements of high quantum efficiency in the front layer, adequate spectral separation for the rear layer, and the physical integration of an anti-crosstalk mask for the stereo imaging application.

1.1. Optimized Layer Stack Specification

The detector system is an indirect-conversion, dual-layer FPD. Each layer comprises a thallium-doped cesium iodide (CsI:Tl) scintillator coupled to an amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) photodiode array. This design is consistent with modern high-performance detectors used in advanced radiographic and fluoroscopic applications.1 The complete stack, from the x-ray entrance window of the front detector to the rear detector's substrate, is specified below. A schematic of this architecture is presented in Figure 1.
Front Detector (Layer 1): Designed to capture the primary image from the first x-ray source.
Entrance Window / Reflector: A 0.5 mm thick layer of Aluminum (Al). This provides structural support, ensures a light-tight enclosure, and acts as a reflector to direct scintillation light back toward the photodiode array, improving light collection efficiency.3
Scintillator: A 0.5 mm thick layer of columnar CsI:Tl. This thickness represents a balance between achieving high x-ray absorption efficiency for the 120 kVp spectrum and mitigating the degradation of spatial resolution (Modulation Transfer Function, MTF) and the increase in optical Swank noise that occurs with thicker scintillators.4 The columnar crystal structure acts as a light guide, channeling optical photons toward the photodiode array and minimizing lateral light spread.3
Photodiode Array: A 1.0 µm thick layer of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). This thin-film layer converts the optical photons from the scintillator into electron-hole pairs.6
Substrate: A 1.0 mm thick glass substrate, primarily composed of silicon dioxide (SiO₂), providing mechanical stability for the photodiode and electronics array.
Inter-Layer Gap and Anti-Crosstalk Mask:
A physical air gap is maintained between the front and rear detectors to accommodate the anti-crosstalk mask. The mask itself is a custom-designed, focused grid specified in detail in Section 4.
Rear Detector (Layer 2): Designed to capture the primary image from the second x-ray source while rejecting crosstalk from the first.
Scintillator: A 0.6 mm thick layer of columnar CsI:Tl. The scintillator is slightly thicker than that of the front layer to enhance the absorption probability for the higher-energy, "hardened" x-ray spectrum that is transmitted through the front detector stack.2
Photodiode Array & Substrate: Identical to the front layer, consisting of a 1.0 µm a-Si:H layer on a 1.0 mm glass (SiO₂) substrate.
The dual-layer configuration creates a fundamental trade-off. The thick front layer (0.5 mm) maximizes the signal for the first image but significantly attenuates and spectrally hardens the beam incident on the rear detector. This necessitates a carefully designed rear detector (0.6 mm scintillator) to maintain adequate quantum efficiency for the remaining high-energy photons. However, the lower photon fluence inherently makes the rear detector's signal more susceptible to electronic noise, a critical factor that must be addressed in the noise model (Section 5) and crosstalk correction strategy (Section 6). Furthermore, while thin layers like the a-Si:H photodiode contribute minimally to overall attenuation compared to the thick scintillators, their inclusion is vital for a physically complete model and ensures extensibility for future, more complex simulations involving charge transport or secondary electron effects.

1.2. Material Properties: Composition and Density

Accurate simulation requires precise knowledge of the density and elemental composition of each material in the beam path. These values are used to calculate the linear attenuation coefficients from the mass attenuation coefficients via the mixture rule.8 The properties for each material in the detector stack are detailed in Table 1.

1.3. Energy-Dependent Mass Attenuation Coefficients

The energy-dependent mass attenuation coefficient, $ \mu/\rho(E) $, is the fundamental quantity governing photon interaction probability. For a compound or mixture, it is calculated using the Bragg additivity rule (mixture rule) 8:
(μ/ρ)compound​(E)=i∑​wi​(μ/ρ)i​(E)
where wi​ is the weight fraction of the i-th constituent element and (μ/ρ)i​(E) is the mass attenuation coefficient of that element at energy E.
Data for all constituent elements (Al, Cs, I, Si, H, O, B, Na, W, N, Ar, Pb, Ta) were sourced from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) XCOM Photon Cross Sections Database.15 These data were used with the mixture rule to compute the coefficients for all materials in the stack over the energy range of 15 keV to 150 keV in 1 keV increments. A summary of these values at key energies is provided in Table 2. The full dataset should be stored as a 1D or 2D texture for efficient lookup within the Metal compute kernel.

1.4. Intrinsic Resolution (MTF) and Swank Noise Factor

Modulation Transfer Function (MTF): The MTF quantifies the spatial resolution of the detector by describing its response to varying spatial frequencies. For an indirect detector, the MTF is primarily limited by the lateral spread of optical photons within the scintillator. Based on empirical data for similar CsI:Tl detectors of ~0.5 mm thickness, a representative MTF can be modeled.21 At a spatial frequency of 2.0 lp/mm, the MTF is approximately 35-40%. The MTF is modeled using a combination of a Gaussian and a Lorentzian function, which captures both the primary light spread and the longer tails from scattered light:
MTF(f)=A⋅e−(σG​f)2+(1−A)⋅1+(σL​f)21​
where f is the spatial frequency in lp/mm. For a 0.5 mm CsI:Tl detector, representative fitted parameters are A=0.7, σG​=0.25 mm, and σL​=0.5 mm. This function should be applied as a convolution kernel in the spatial domain or as a filter in the frequency domain to the simulated noiseless image. A slight energy dependence exists, primarily due to K-fluorescence reabsorption above the Cs/I K-edges (33-36 keV), which can degrade high-frequency MTF.22 For this simulation, a single MTF based on the mean energy of the incident spectrum is a sufficient and practical model.
Swank Factor (ISwank​): The Swank factor accounts for the added noise arising from statistical fluctuations in the energy conversion process, which broadens the single-photon pulse-height distribution. It is a key determinant of the Detective Quantum Efficiency (DQE). The total Swank factor is the product of the radiation Swank factor (Irad​) and the optical Swank factor (Iopt​).5
Irad​ is degraded by processes like K-fluorescence escape, where a characteristic x-ray escapes the detector, depositing less than the full incident energy.
Iopt​ is degraded by the depth-dependent probability of collecting optical photons; photons generated deeper in the scintillator have a lower chance of being detected.
Direct measurement is complex, but the Swank factor can be estimated from published DQE data using the relationship DQE(0)=QE×ISwank​. Given that high-performance CsI detectors have a zero-frequency DQE(0) of ~65-70% 21 and a calculated quantum efficiency (QE) of ~75-80% at the mean energy of a 120 kVp beam, a representative Swank factor is estimated to be
ISwank​≈0.88. This value will be used as a constant in the noise model.

2. Front-Layer Response Model

This section translates the physical properties defined in Section 1 into a quantitative, closed-form model describing how the front detector layer converts incident x-ray energy into a measurable electronic signal. The model provides the necessary equations and parameters to simulate the detector's response with high fidelity.

2.1. Derivation of Photon Absorption Probability, A1​(E)

The probability that an incident photon of energy E is absorbed within the front scintillator layer is its quantum efficiency (QE). This is governed by the Beer-Lambert law of attenuation. The absorption probability, denoted A1​(E), for the front scintillator of thickness t1​=0.5 mm is:
A1​(E)=1−e−μCsI​(E)⋅t1​
Here, μCsI​(E) is the energy-dependent linear attenuation coefficient of CsI, calculated as the product of its mass attenuation coefficient (μ/ρ)CsI​(E) from Table 2 and its density ρCsI​ from Table 1. This probability is calculated for each energy bin in the poly-energetic simulation.

2.2. Optical and Electronic Conversion Gain, G1​

The overall gain, G1​, converts the total energy absorbed in a pixel (in keV) into the final digitized signal (in Analog-to-Digital Units, or ADU). This is a cascaded process involving several distinct physical stages, each with its own efficiency. Modeling the gain chain in this way provides a physically grounded framework that is more robust and extensible than using a single arbitrary conversion factor.
The total gain G1​ is given by:

G1​=gopt​×ηcpl​×ηpd​×gelec​
The components are defined as follows:
Optical Conversion Gain (gopt​): The number of optical photons produced per keV of absorbed x-ray energy. For thallium-doped CsI, this value is high and relatively constant across the diagnostic energy range. A value of gopt​=54 photons/keV is used, based on vendor specifications and literature.10
Optical Coupling Efficiency (ηcpl​): The fraction of scintillation photons that successfully escape the scintillator and reach the photodiode array. This is highly dependent on the detector's construction, including the columnar structure of the CsI, the presence of a reflective layer, and the quality of the optical interface. For a modern FPD with columnar CsI and an integrated reflector, a representative value of ηcpl​=0.75 is assumed.
Photodiode Quantum Efficiency (ηpd​): The efficiency of the a-Si:H photodiode in converting an incident optical photon into an electron-hole pair. The emission spectrum of CsI:Tl peaks at a wavelength of 550 nm 10, which is well-matched to the spectral sensitivity of a-Si:H photodiodes.6 A typical value for this efficiency is
ηpd​=0.80 e⁻/photon.
Electronic Gain (gelec​): The gain of the readout electronics (preamplifier and ADC) that converts the collected charge (number of electrons) into a final digital value (ADU). Assuming a 16-bit ADC (0-65535 ADU) and a pixel full-well capacity of 6.5×106 electrons, the electronic gain is gelec​=65535/(6.5×106)≈0.01 ADU/e⁻.
Combining these factors, the total gain for the front layer is:
G1​=54×0.75×0.80×0.01=0.324 ADU/keV.

2.3. Additive Electronic Noise Characterization, σread,12​

Additive electronic noise, or read noise, is the noise inherent in the detector electronics, present even in the absence of any x-ray signal. It sets the noise floor of the detector. The primary sources are thermal (Johnson) noise in the data line resistances and switching (kTC) noise from the thin-film transistors (TFTs).27 Empirical measurements of modern a-Si:H FPDs report read noise levels in the range of 1000 to 2000 electrons (RMS).27 For this model, a conservative value of
σread,1,e​=1500 electrons is specified.
This noise must be expressed in the same units as the signal (ADU). The noise variance in ADU is:
σread,12​=(σread,1,e​×gelec​)2=(1500 e−×0.01 ADU/e−)2=225 ADU2

2.4. Metal Shader-Ready Parameterization

Directly calculating the exponential function in the absorption probability equation A1​(E) for every energy bin and every ray within the Metal shader would be computationally prohibitive and would likely violate the performance budget. To optimize this, the energy-dependent function A1​(E) is pre-computed and made available to the shader as either a lookup table (LUT) or a polynomial fit. This replaces a costly transcendental function call with a fast memory lookup or a few multiply-add operations.
The gain G1​ and read noise variance σread,12​ are energy-independent constants and can be passed to the shader via a small, efficient uniform buffer. Table 3 summarizes these shader-ready parameters.

3. Spectral Hardening & Fluence to Rear Layer

The front detector acts as a spectral filter, preferentially absorbing lower-energy photons. This "beam hardening" effect fundamentally alters the x-ray spectrum that reaches the rear detector. Accurately modeling this spectral shift is paramount for simulating the rear detector's response and is the physical basis for the dual-layer system's energy-separation capabilities.2

3.1. Modeling the Transmitted Spectrum, Φ2​(E)

The photon fluence incident on the rear detector, Φ2​(E), is the initial source spectrum, Φ0​(E), attenuated by every layer of the front detector stack specified in Section 1.1. The total transmission factor for the front stack, Tstack,1​(E), is given by:
$$T_{stack,1}(E) = \exp\left( - \left \right)$$
The transmitted spectrum is therefore:

Φ2​(E)=Φ0​(E)⋅Tstack,1​(E)
The effect of beam hardening can be quantified by the shift in the mean energy of the spectrum. The mean energy of the initial spectrum is Eˉ0​=∫Φ0​(E)dE∫EΦ0​(E)dE​, and for the transmitted spectrum is Eˉ2​=∫Φ2​(E)dE∫EΦ2​(E)dE​. For the specified 120 kVp source spectrum and the front detector stack, the mean energy is expected to shift from approximately Eˉ0​≈62 keV to Eˉ2​≈81 keV. This significant increase of ΔEˉ≈19 keV underscores that the rear detector is effectively imaging with a different, higher-energy x-ray source. This is a crucial detail, as all subsequent modeling for the rear detector (e.g., its absorption probability and signal generation) must use the hardened spectrum Φ2​(E), not the original source spectrum Φ0​(E).

3.2. Efficient In-Shader Implementation of Spectral Attenuation

The existing forward-projection code tracks an array of energy-dependent weights for each ray, representing the unattenuated fluence in each energy bin. To model the spectral filtering effect of the front detector, these weights must be multiplied by the transmission factor Tstack,1​(E) before they are used to calculate the rear detector's signal.
As with the absorption probability in Section 2, calculating the exponential for Tstack,1​(E) inside the shader for every ray and energy bin is inefficient. The optimal approach is to pre-compute the transmission function Tstack,1​(E) for the entire energy range (15-150 keV) and store it in a 1D lookup table (LUT) accessible from the shader. This LUT can be stored in fast constant memory or as a MTLTexture1D.
The following Metal Shading Language (MSL) code snippet demonstrates how this is efficiently integrated into the existing pipeline. This logic would execute after the ray has been traced through the patient and before the signal for the rear detector is calculated.

Code snippet


#include <metal_stdlib>

using namespace metal;

// This function simulates the spectral hardening caused by the front detector stack.
// It modifies the ray's energy weights in-place.
//
// @param ray_energy_weights A pointer to the array of fluence weights for the current ray,
//                           one for each energy bin. This is the fluence after passing
//                           through the patient.
// @param front_stack_transmission_lut A pre-computed lookup table containing the
//                                     transmission factor T_stack,1(E) for each energy bin.
// @param num_energy_bins The total number of energy bins in the simulation.
//
void apply_front_detector_hardening(thread float* ray_energy_weights,
                                    constant float* front_stack_transmission_lut,
                                    uint num_energy_bins)
{
    // Iterate through each energy bin of the poly-energetic ray
    for (uint e = 0; e < num_energy_bins; ++e) {
        // Multiply the weight for this energy bin by the pre-computed transmission factor.
        // This efficiently applies the attenuation from the entire front detector stack
        // without expensive in-shader calculations.
        ray_energy_weights[e] *= front_stack_transmission_lut[e];
    }
}


This implementation adds only one multiplication and one memory lookup per energy bin to the existing compute kernel, ensuring minimal performance impact and adherence to the strict runtime budget.

4. Rear Layer & Slatted Anti-Crosstalk Mask

To enable stereo imaging at ±6°, a physical barrier is required to prevent x-rays from one source from contaminating the image on the detector intended for the other source. This section specifies the design of a focused, slatted anti-crosstalk mask positioned immediately in front of the rear detector. The design is a multi-parameter optimization that balances near-perfect crosstalk rejection with high transmission for the desired beam and practical manufacturability.

4.1. Optimal Material Selection for High-Energy Crosstalk Suppression

Objective: The mask's septa (the absorbing walls) must attenuate the unwanted beam by a factor of at least 1000 (≥99.9% attenuation, or transmission ≤ 0.1%). The beam incident on the mask is the hardened spectrum from Section 3, with a mean energy around 80 keV.
Material Candidates: High-Z, high-density materials are required for efficient x-ray absorption. The primary candidates are Lead (Pb), Tantalum (Ta), and Tungsten (W).29
Analysis and Justification: A comparison of the linear attenuation coefficients (μ=(μ/ρ)×ρ) at 80 keV reveals the most effective material.
Lead (Pb): ρ=11.34 g/cm³, (μ/ρ)≈2.42 cm²/g ⟹μ≈27.4 cm⁻¹
Tantalum (Ta): ρ=16.65 g/cm³, (μ/ρ)≈7.59 cm²/g ⟹μ≈126.2 cm⁻¹
Tungsten (W): ρ=19.3 g/cm³, (μ/ρ)≈7.81 cm²/g ⟹μ≈150.7 cm⁻¹
Conclusion: Tungsten (W) is the superior choice. Its linear attenuation coefficient at 80 keV is significantly higher than that of lead and slightly better than tantalum. This means a thinner tungsten septum can provide the same level of attenuation, which is critical for maximizing the geometric transmission of the desired primary beam. Furthermore, recent advances in additive manufacturing (3D printing) allow for the fabrication of pure tungsten grids with very high aspect ratios and small feature sizes, which is ideal for this custom application.30

4.2. Geometric Design and Optimization

The mask is a 1D focused grid, with septa angled to align perfectly with the diverging x-rays from the desired source. The key design parameters are the septa height (h), septa thickness (ts​), and the width of the interspace or slit (w).
Focusing Distance: The grid must be focused to the source-to-detector distance (SDD) of 1500 mm.
Grid Ratio (GR): Defined as GR=h/w. A high grid ratio is required to effectively reject off-axis radiation. For the stereo geometry, the unwanted beam from the opposing source arrives at an angle of approximately 12° relative to the desired beam's path. A high grid ratio ensures that these off-axis rays have a long path length through the tungsten septa. A grid ratio of GR=10:1 is selected as a standard, effective value.
Primary Transmission and Period: The geometric transmission for the primary beam is Tgeom​=w/(w+ts​). The design target is Tgeom​≥95%. This imposes the constraint that w≥19ts​. To minimize aliasing artifacts, the grid period (P=w+ts​) should match the detector pixel pitch of 0.5 mm.
Combining these constraints: w+ts​=0.5 mm and w=19ts​.
Solving yields: 20ts​=0.5 mm ⟹ts​=0.025 mm and w=0.475 mm.
Septa Height: With GR=10:1 and w=0.475 mm, the required septa height is h=10×w=4.75 mm.
Crosstalk Attenuation Verification: A ray from the unwanted source (at 12° off-axis) must traverse a path length L through the tungsten septa. Due to the grid's geometry, any such ray is guaranteed to be intercepted. The attenuation is e−μW​(80keV)⋅L. With μW​(80keV)≈150.7 cm⁻¹ and path lengths on the order of millimeters, the attenuation factor is extremely high (e−15≈3×10−7 for just 1 mm of travel), far exceeding the required 99.9% suppression.
Penumbral Blur: The geometric unsharpness, or penumbra (P), caused by the finite focal spot size is given by P=FSS×(OID/SOD).31 Here, the focal spot size is
FSS=0.2 mm, the object-to-image distance (OID) is the small gap between the mask and the scintillator (assume 2 mm), and the source-to-object distance is SOD=SDD−OID≈1498 mm.
P=0.2 mm×(2/1498)≈0.00027 mm. This is negligible and well below the specified tolerance of ≤0.05 mm.
The final optimized parameters for the anti-crosstalk mask are summarized in Table 4.

4.3. Analytic Transmission Model and Voxelized Representation

For simulation, the effect of the mask on the desired beam is modeled as a constant transmission factor, T2​=0.95. The interspace material is air, whose attenuation over 4.75 mm is negligible at these energies.
To model the mask's physical presence for ray-tracing, a voxelized representation can be used. This can be implemented as a 2D texture with the same dimensions as the detector array.
Representation: An 8-bit material ID texture. A value of '0' can represent the air interspace, and a value of '1' can represent the tungsten septa. The ray-tracing kernel would then sample this texture and apply the appropriate attenuation based on the material ID.
Memory Footprint: A 720x720 texture with 8-bit (1 byte) values would occupy 720×720×1=518.4 kB. This is a trivial memory cost and fits easily within the budget. Since the grid pattern is periodic, an even more compact representation storing only a single period is possible, but a full texture map is simpler to implement.
The design of this mask has a crucial secondary benefit. In addition to blocking the primary beam from the opposing source, its high-aspect-ratio structure makes it an effective anti-scatter grid. It will absorb a significant fraction of Compton-scattered photons generated within the patient, which arrive at the detector from a wide range of angles. This will improve the contrast-to-noise ratio of the rear image, partially offsetting the signal reduction caused by the front detector's attenuation.

5. Integrated Signal & Noise Model

This section consolidates the physical principles and parameters from the preceding sections into a unified mathematical framework for simulating the signal and noise in each pixel of the dual-layer detector. This framework provides the final equations and pseudocode necessary for implementation in the Metal-based forward projection pipeline.

5.1. Unified Per-Pixel Signal Chain Formulation

The mean signal value, I(u,v), in a given pixel is the result of a cascade of processes: patient attenuation, detector absorption, energy deposition, and electronic gain. The signal must be calculated independently for each layer, using the appropriate spectrum and detector parameters.
Front-Layer Mean Signal (Ifront​):
The front layer interacts with the original source spectrum, Φ0​(E), after it has passed through the patient. The mean signal in ADU is the integral of the absorbed energy multiplied by the total gain, G1​.
Ifront​(u,v)=G1​∫0Emax​​Φpatient​(E)⋅A1​(E)⋅E⋅dE
where:
Φpatient​(E)=Φ0​(E)⋅exp(−∫path​μpatient​(l,E)dl) is the energy-dependent photon fluence per unit area at the detector plane, as calculated by the existing ray-tracing forward projector.
A1​(E) is the front-layer absorption probability from Section 2.
G1​ is the front-layer total gain (ADU/keV) from Section 2.
E is the photon energy.
Rear-Layer Mean Signal (Irear​):
The rear layer interacts with a spectrum that has been attenuated by the patient and the entire front detector stack, including the anti-crosstalk mask.
Irear​(u,v)=G2​∫0Emax​​Φpatient​(E)⋅Tstack,1​(E)⋅T2​⋅A2​(E)⋅E⋅dE
where:
Tstack,1​(E) is the transmission factor of the front detector stack (Section 3).
T2​ is the primary transmission of the anti-crosstalk mask (0.95, from Section 4).
A2​(E) is the rear-layer absorption probability, calculated as 1−e−μCsI​(E)⋅t2​ with t2​=0.6 mm.
G2​ is the rear-layer total gain, calculated analogously to G1​.
This formulation highlights the necessity of managing two distinct sets of physical parameters within the simulation. The core logic can be reused, but it must be supplied with the correct spectrum, absorption probability, and gain for each layer.

5.2. Comprehensive Noise Propagation

The total noise in the final image is a combination of several independent stochastic processes. The total variance is the sum of the individual variances.
1. Quantum and Swank Noise:
The fundamental noise source is the Poisson-distributed arrival of x-ray photons. The variance in the number of interacting photons is amplified by the gain chain and further increased by the statistical nature of the scintillation process (Swank noise). The variance of the signal due to these combined effects is:
σquantum+swank2​(u,v)=ISwank​G2​∫0Emax​​Φincident​(E)⋅A(E)⋅E2⋅dE
where Φincident​(E) is the spectrum incident on the specific layer, G is the gain for that layer, and ISwank​ is the Swank factor from Section 1.4.
2. Electronic Noise:
This is the additive read noise variance, σread2​, which is independent of the signal level (Section 2.3).
Total Noise Variance:
The total variance in a single pixel signal for a given layer is:

σtotal2​(u,v)=σquantum+swank2​(u,v)+σread2​
A critical implication of this model is the different noise characteristics of the two layers. The front layer, with its high incident fluence, will be quantum-noise-dominant, where σtotal,12​≈σquantum+swank,12​. The rear layer, receiving a heavily attenuated beam, will have a much lower quantum noise component. Consequently, the fixed electronic noise σread,22​ will constitute a larger fraction of the total noise, potentially making the rear image electronics-noise-dominant, especially in dense regions of the projection. This is a known challenge in dual-layer systems and must be modeled accurately to produce realistic images.32
3. CsI Fluorescence and Optical Crosstalk:
This effect is a deterministic blur, not a random noise source. It is modeled by convolving the final, noiseless simulated image with the detector's Point Spread Function (PSF), the Fourier transform of which is the MTF defined in Section 1.4.

5.3. Implementation via Metal Shading Language Pseudocode

The following MSL-style function encapsulates the calculation of the mean signal and its variance for a single pixel. This function would be called twice per ray—once for the front layer and once for the rear layer (after updating the ray_energy_fluence array).

Code snippet


#include <metal_stdlib>

using namespace metal;

// A structure to hold the calculated signal and variance for a pixel.
struct PixelResponse {
    float mean_signal_adu;
    float total_variance_adu;
};

// Calculates the mean signal and total noise variance for a single detector pixel.
// This function is generic and can be used for either the front or rear layer
// by providing the appropriate parameters.

{
    float mean_energy_deposited = 0.0f;
    float mean_squared_energy_deposited = 0.0f;

    // Integrate over the energy spectrum
    for (uint e = 0; e < num_energy_bins; ++e) {
        // Fluence interacting in this bin
        float interacting_fluence = incident_fluence_per_bin[e] * absorption_prob_lut[e];
        
        // Energy of this bin
        float energy = energy_per_bin_kev[e];
        
        // Accumulate first and second moments of deposited energy
        mean_energy_deposited += interacting_fluence * energy * energy_bin_width_kev[e];
        mean_squared_energy_deposited += interacting_fluence * (energy * energy) * energy_bin_width_kev[e];
    }

    // Calculate mean signal in ADU
    float mean_signal = gain_adu_per_kev * mean_energy_deposited;

    // Calculate signal-dependent noise variance (quantum + Swank) in ADU^2
    float signal_dependent_variance = (gain_adu_per_kev * gain_adu_per_kev / swank_factor) 
                                      * mean_squared_energy_deposited;

    PixelResponse result;
    result.mean_signal_adu = mean_signal;
    result.total_variance_adu = signal_dependent_variance + read_noise_variance_adu;
    
    return result;
}

// In the main kernel, after generating the final noisy signal:
// float final_noisy_signal = result.mean_signal_adu + random_normal() * sqrt(result.total_variance_adu);
// This noisy signal is then convolved with the MTF kernel to apply spatial blur.



6. Crosstalk-Correction Strategy

The physical anti-crosstalk mask specified in Section 4 is designed to suppress the majority (>99.9%) of the unwanted signal from the opposing stereo x-ray source. However, to meet the stringent requirement of ≤ 0.1% residual crosstalk, a software-based correction is necessary to remove the remaining "ghost" signal. The strategy outlined here is co-designed with the hardware mask; the mask's high efficiency enables the use of a simple, computationally inexpensive correction algorithm that adheres to the strict runtime budget.

6.1. Design of a Minimalist Calibration Protocol

To characterize the residual crosstalk, a one-time calibration procedure is required. This protocol uses simple phantoms to build a model of the leakage between the two stereo channels.
Acquisition 1: Air Scans (Flat-Fields). Acquire images with no object in the beam, one for the left (-6°) source and one for the right (+6°) source.
The left-source acquisition yields a primary image on the front detector (Iair,Lfront​) and a crosstalk image on the rear detector (Cair,L→Rrear​).
The right-source acquisition yields a primary image on the rear detector (Iair,Rrear​) and a crosstalk image on the front detector (Cair,R→Lfront​).
This provides a baseline, spatially-varying crosstalk map. For example, the crosstalk coefficient map for leakage from left to right is kL→R​(u,v)=Cair,L→Rrear​(u,v)/Iair,Lfront​(u,v).
Acquisition 2: Step-Wedge Scan. Acquire images of a copper (Cu) step-wedge phantom. This provides response data across a range of beam hardness levels, allowing for verification that the crosstalk coefficient k is reasonably constant with respect to spectral changes. For this model, we will assume k is constant, a valid assumption given the high efficacy of the physical mask.

6.2. Analysis and Selection of a Runtime-Compliant Correction Algorithm

Two primary classes of algorithms could be considered for this task:
Option A: Single-Pass Linear Subtraction (De-ghosting). This method assumes the residual crosstalk signal is a simple linear fraction of the primary signal from the opposing source. Given the effectiveness of the tungsten mask, this is a highly valid assumption. The ghost image is estimated by scaling the primary image from the other channel and subtracting it.
Option B: Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR). This approach would incorporate the crosstalk physics directly into the system matrix of an iterative reconstruction algorithm.33 It would solve for the true images by simultaneously minimizing a data fidelity term and a regularization term. While potentially more accurate for large, non-linear crosstalk, it is computationally intensive, requiring multiple forward and back-projections.
Justification for Selection: The project's runtime constraint of adding ≤ 0.15 s to the existing 0.95 s projection time makes any iterative approach like MBIR infeasible. A single iteration of MBIR would far exceed this budget. Therefore, the Single-Pass Linear Subtraction method is the only viable choice. The system is intentionally designed (hardware mask + software correction) to make this simple, fast algorithm sufficient.
A refinement to the basic linear model is to account for the differing spatial resolution of the two layers. The ghost image on one layer is blurred by the MTF of the other layer's imaging chain. 2 notes that the front layer MTF is substantially higher than the rear layer MTF. Therefore, a more accurate ghost estimate involves a convolution:
Ghost on front layer: CR→L​≈kR→L​⋅(Iprimary,R​∗PSFrear​)
Ghost on rear layer: CL→R​≈kL→R​⋅(Iprimary,L​∗PSFfront​)
where PSF is the point spread function corresponding to the layer's MTF.

6.3. Algorithmic Flowchart and Kernel Layout

The chosen correction algorithm is simple to implement as a single, fast GPU compute pass.
Algorithmic Flowchart:
Input: Raw front detector image (Iraw,front​), Raw rear detector image (Iraw,rear​). These are the images after the detector response model (signal + noise + MTF blur) has been applied.
Identify Components:
Iraw,front​=Iprimary,L​+CR→L​
Iraw,rear​=Iprimary,R​+CL→R​
Estimate Ghost Signals:
Approximate the primary signals with the raw signals (since crosstalk is small): Iprimary,L​≈Iraw,front​ and Iprimary,R​≈Iraw,rear​.
CR→L​(u,v)=kR→L​⋅Iraw,rear​(u,v)
CL→R​(u,v)=kL→R​⋅Iraw,front​(u,v)
Correct Images:
Corrected Left Image: IL′​(u,v)=Iraw,front​(u,v)−CR→L​(u,v)
Corrected Right Image: IR′​(u,v)=Iraw,rear​(u,v)−CL→R​(u,v)
Output: Corrected stereo pair (IL′​,IR′​).
Metal Kernel Layout:
This process can be implemented in a single compute kernel dispatched with one thread per pixel.
Kernel Name: crosstalkCorrectionKernel
Inputs:
texture2d<float, access::read> rawFrontImage
texture2d<float, access::read> rawRearImage
constant float& k_R_to_L (crosstalk coefficient)
constant float& k_L_to_R (crosstalk coefficient)
Outputs:
texture2d<float, access::write> correctedLeftImage
texture2d<float, access::write> correctedRightImage
Threadgroup Size: 2D, e.g., 16x16.
Kernel Logic (per thread):
Get pixel coordinate gid.
Read pixel values: front_val = rawFrontImage.read(gid); and rear_val = rawRearImage.read(gid);
Calculate corrected values: corr_L = front_val - k_R_to_L * rear_val; and corr_R = rear_val - k_L_to_R * front_val;
Write results: correctedLeftImage.write(corr_L, gid); and correctedRightImage.write(corr_R, gid);
This is an "embarrassingly parallel" kernel with minimal computation and coherent memory access, ensuring it will execute in a fraction of a millisecond, well within the performance budget. If the MTF-based blurring refinement is included, the correction would involve an additional convolution kernel pass, which must be implemented efficiently using threadgroup memory as described in Section 7.

7. GPU Implementation Guidance for Apple Silicon

This section provides specific, actionable guidance for implementing the complete detector model efficiently on the target Apple M4 Max GPU architecture. The recommendations focus on leveraging the unique features of Apple Silicon, particularly its unified memory architecture, and adhering to Metal best practices to meet the stringent performance and memory constraints.

7.1. Memory Layout and Resource Management in a Unified Architecture

The unified memory architecture of Apple Silicon is a key performance enabler, eliminating the traditional bottleneck of explicit data transfers between CPU and GPU memory.35 The implementation must fully exploit this advantage.
CT Volume Data: The 0.5 mm isotropic thoracic CT volume should be stored in a MTLTextureType3D. This is crucial because it allows the GPU's texture sampling hardware to perform trilinear interpolation during ray-tracing. Hardware-accelerated interpolation is significantly faster and more power-efficient than implementing it manually in the shader.37 The texture should be created with
MTLPixelFormatR16Sint to store the HU values and MTLStorageModeShared to allow zero-copy access by both CPU and GPU.
Detector Image Buffers: The front and rear detector images, both raw and corrected, should be MTLTextureType2D resources. A 32-bit floating-point format, such as MTLPixelFormatR32Float, is recommended to accommodate the high dynamic range of the simulated signal. These should also use MTLStorageModeShared.
Lookup Tables (LUTs): The energy-dependent data for mass attenuation coefficients (μ/ρ), absorption probabilities (A(E)), and transmission factors (T(E)) are relatively small (a few kilobytes). They should be stored in the constant address space. This is the fastest read-only memory available to the GPU, as it is aggressively cached and optimized for uniform access across threads in a warp. This can be achieved by passing a pointer to a buffer created with MTLResourceStorageModeShared into the shader function with the constant attribute.
Resource Allocation: All large resources (textures, buffers) should be allocated once at initialization and reused across multiple projection calculations to avoid the high CPU overhead of resource creation.38

7.2. Kernel Design: Threadgroups, Shared Memory, and Argument Buffers

Efficient kernel design is critical to maximizing GPU utilization and throughput.
Threadgroup Sizing: The primary forward-projection kernel, which will now include the detector physics simulation, should be dispatched with 2D threadgroups. A size of 16x16 (256 threads) is a robust starting point for Apple Silicon GPUs. This size balances parallelism with register and threadgroup memory pressure. The optimal size should be determined empirically using Xcode's Metal System Trace and GPU counters.39
Threadgroup Shared Memory (threadgroup): While the core ray-tracing and per-pixel detector physics calculations are independent, threadgroup memory is essential for efficiently implementing the MTF blur. The blur is a spatial convolution. A naive implementation would require each thread to perform multiple slow reads from global device memory. A high-performance approach involves:
Dispatching the convolution kernel in tiles.
Each threadgroup collaboratively loads a tile of the source image (plus a halo region for boundary pixels) into fast threadgroup memory.
A memory barrier (threadgroup_barrier(mem_flags::mem_threadgroup)) is issued to ensure all loads are complete.
Each thread then performs its convolution calculations, reading exclusively from the fast shared memory.
The results are written back to the output texture in global memory.
This technique dramatically reduces global memory bandwidth, a common bottleneck in image processing kernels.38
Argument Buffers: With a growing number of resources (CT volume, multiple detector textures, several LUTs, uniform constants), using argument buffers (MTLArgumentEncoder) is the recommended practice.40 This involves encoding all resource references into a single buffer that is passed to the kernel. It reduces CPU-side overhead for binding individual resources and is more scalable as the simulation complexity increases.

7.3. Performance and Memory Budget Analysis

The proposed detector model must fit within the specified performance and memory budgets.
Memory Footprint Analysis:
Existing: CT Volume (512x512x768 voxels @ 2 bytes/voxel) ≈ 384 MB.
Added by this model:
Detector Images: 4 textures (raw front/rear, corrected front/rear) @ 720x720x4 bytes ≈ 8.4 MB.
LUTs and constants: < 1 MB.
Convolution tile in threadgroup memory: e.g., (16+8)x(16+8) pixels x 4 bytes ≈ 2.3 kB per threadgroup (negligible).
Total Added Memory: < 10 MB. This is well within the total system budget of ≤ 8 GB and represents a negligible increase.
Computational Overhead Analysis:
Detector Physics: The added operations per ray are a few LUT lookups and multiply-adds for each energy bin. For a 720x720 image and 20 energy bins, this adds on the order of 720×720×20×∼10 floating-point operations, or ~100 MFLOPs.
Crosstalk Correction: This is a simple subtraction kernel, adding ~720×720×3≈1.5 MFLOPs.
MTF Convolution: This is the most significant addition. A separable 9x1 convolution pass requires 720×720×9×2≈9.3 MFLOPs per pass. Two passes for a 2D blur is ~18.6 MFLOPs.
Total Overhead: The total added computation is on the order of 120 MFLOPs. The existing 0.95 s runtime for a full poly-energetic ray-tracer implies a workload of many TFLOPs. The additional computation is therefore a very small fraction (<1%) of the existing workload. The primary performance consideration is not the raw FLOPs but the memory access patterns, which have been optimized through the use of textures and threadgroup memory. The projected wall-clock increase of ≤ 0.15 s (15%) is a conservative and achievable target.

8. System Validation Plan

To ensure the implemented simulation is a faithful representation of the physical system, a rigorous validation plan is required. This plan uses standard radiological phantoms to systematically verify each key component of the physics model, from energy response to spatial resolution and crosstalk suppression. The data acquired for validation can also be used for the calibration of the crosstalk correction algorithm, creating an efficient workflow.

8.1. Phantom-Based Verification

A multi-phantom approach is necessary to decouple and independently validate the different aspects of the simulation.
1. Energy Response and Spectral Hardening Validation:
Phantom: Air (flat-field) and a Copper (Cu) step-wedge phantom.
Procedure:
Physically acquire images of air and the step-wedge phantom with the dual-layer detector.
Simulate the same acquisitions using the implemented model.
Analysis: Compare the mean signal values in large, uniform regions of interest (ROIs) for both the front and rear detectors, for both air and each step of the wedge. The ratio of signals between the front and rear detectors, and the ratio of signals between different wedge steps, must match between the physical measurement and the simulation.
Purpose: This directly validates the accuracy of the absorption probability models (A1​(E), A2​(E)) and the spectral hardening model (Tstack,1​(E)), as these govern the energy-dependent response of the system.41
2. Spatial Resolution (MTF) Validation:
Phantom: A high-contrast resolution phantom featuring a slanted edge, such as the Leeds Test Object TOR 18FG.42
Procedure:
Acquire a physical image of the slanted edge.
Simulate an image of an identical virtual slanted edge.
Analysis: Process both the real and simulated images using the standardized slanted-edge method to calculate the presampled MTF.
Purpose: This validates that the MTF model implemented in the simulation (e.g., via convolution with a PSF) accurately reproduces the spatial resolution characteristics of the physical detector.
3. Integrated System and Crosstalk Validation:
Phantom: A complex anthropomorphic phantom with known material inserts, such as the CIRS Multi-Energy CT QA phantom (Model 662) or a Catphan phantom.43
Procedure:
Acquire a physical stereo DRR pair of the phantom.
Use the vendor-provided CT scan of the phantom as input to the simulation pipeline to generate a simulated stereo DRR pair.
Analysis:
HU Accuracy: If a reconstruction algorithm is available, reconstruct a CT volume from the simulated DRRs. Compare the mean Hounsfield Unit (HU) values in ROIs placed on known material inserts (e.g., water, bone, acrylic, iodine solutions) against their ground-truth values.
Crosstalk Quantification: In the corrected simulated DRRs, identify a region corresponding to a high-contrast edge in the opposing view (e.g., the edge of the phantom against air). Measure the maximum residual signal (ghost artifact) in this region and express it as a percentage of the peak primary signal in the image.
Purpose: This provides the final end-to-end validation of the entire simulation pipeline, including the forward projector, detector physics, and crosstalk correction algorithm.

8.2. Definition of Quantitative Pass/Fail Criteria

The simulation will be considered validated and accepted for production use if it meets the following quantitative criteria:
HU Accuracy: For reconstructed volumes from simulated DRRs of the CIRS phantom, the mean HU values in specified material inserts must be within ±2 HU of the ground-truth values provided by the phantom manufacturer for bone and soft tissue inserts.43
Crosstalk Suppression: The maximum residual ghost signal, measured in a region of air adjacent to a high-contrast edge in the anthropomorphic phantom simulation, must be less than 0.1% of the peak primary signal in the corresponding image.
Runtime Performance: The total wall-clock time for generating a complete, corrected stereo DRR pair (including forward projection, detector physics simulation, and crosstalk correction) must be less than or equal to 1.10 seconds when benchmarked on the target Apple M4 Max hardware.
Memory Usage: The total GPU memory allocated by the application during the simulation process must remain at or below 8 GB.
