Technical Specification for Metadata-Driven Stereo DRR Projection Geometry

This document provides a comprehensive, physics-grounded, and implementation-ready specification for transforming a 3D Computed Tomography (CT) volume from its native voxel space to a stereo X-ray acquisition geometry. It furnishes all necessary mathematical derivations, coordinate system definitions, and performance-optimized code to enable a software engineering team to implement a high-fidelity, real-time Digitally Reconstructed Radiograph (DRR) engine on Apple M4 Max GPUs. The entire geometric pipeline is designed to be driven directly and automatically from DICOM metadata.

1. Coordinate-Frame Taxonomy

A rigorous and unambiguous definition of all coordinate systems is fundamental to a correct implementation. Errors in axis orientation or handedness are a common failure point in medical imaging pipelines. The following coordinate systems form the basis of this specification.

1.1. Core Definitions and Diagrams

The transformation pipeline involves seven distinct coordinate systems, each with a specific origin, axis orientation, and handedness. Their hierarchical relationship is centered around the IEC World Coordinate System (WCS), which serves as the global reference frame.
Voxel Coordinate System (VCS): An integer-based, right-handed system used to index into the 3D CT data array. The origin (0,0,0) corresponds to the first voxel of the first slice. The axes are i (columns), j (rows), and k (slices).
DICOM Patient Coordinate System (PCS): A left-handed coordinate system (LPS) defined by the DICOM standard.1 Its origin is arbitrary but fixed relative to the patient. The axes are defined relative to a patient in the anatomical position (supine, head-first):
+X: From Right to Left
+Y: From Anterior to Posterior
+Z: From Inferior to Superior
IEC 61217 World Coordinate System (WCS): The primary, right-handed, room-fixed coordinate system defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 61217 for radiotherapy equipment.3 All equipment poses are defined within this frame. For a supine patient, its axes are:
+X: Towards the patient's Right
+Y: Towards the gantry, which is Anterior for a supine patient
+Z: Upwards, towards the patient's Superior direction
Isocenter Coordinate System (ICS): This system is coincident with the WCS. Its origin (0,0,0) is the machine isocenter, the fixed point in space about which the gantry, collimator, and patient support system rotate.5
Source Coordinate Frames (SL, SR): Two right-handed frames, one for each X-ray source. The origin of each frame is located at the focal spot of the respective source. Their orientations are defined by the gantry rotation.
Detector Coordinate Frames (DL, DR): Two 2D right-handed frames, one for each flat-panel detector. The origin is the geometric center of the detector panel. The u and v axes span the detector plane, with the w (or normal) axis pointing from the detector center towards the source.7
The diagram below illustrates the hierarchy, with the WCS/ICS as the parent frame for all other machine components.

1.2. The Critical Handedness Transformation (PCS → WCS)

The single most critical transformation in this pipeline is the conversion from the left-handed DICOM Patient Coordinate System (PCS) to the right-handed IEC World Coordinate System (WCS). DICOM uses a Left-Posterior-Superior (LPS) convention 1, whereas IEC 61217 and standard 3D graphics environments like Metal use a Right-Anterior-Superior (RAS) convention.10
A point P_PCS in the LPS system is transformed into the WCS P_WCS by inverting the X and Y axes. The Z axes (Superior) in both systems are aligned. This is accomplished with a simple scaling matrix:
PWCS​=MWCS←PCS​⋅PPCS​
Where the handedness-change matrix MWCS←PCS​ is:
MWCS←PCS​=​−1000​0−100​0010​0001​​
This matrix correctly maps:
DICOM +X (Left) to WCS -X (Left), which is equivalent to WCS +X (Right).
DICOM +Y (Posterior) to WCS -Y (Posterior), which is equivalent to WCS +Y (Anterior).
DICOM +Z (Superior) to WCS +Z (Superior).
This transformation is essential and must be applied after converting from voxel coordinates to PCS to correctly orient the patient volume within the machine's world space.

2. Metadata-Driven VCS → PCS → WCS Transform Chain

This section provides the closed-form formulas and implementation logic to transform a CT voxel index (i,j,k) directly into the IEC World Coordinate System (WCS) in millimeters, using only standard DICOM tags.

2.1. Derivation of the VCS → PCS Transform (Mpcs←vcs​)

The transformation from the Voxel Coordinate System (VCS) to the DICOM Patient Coordinate System (PCS) is defined by a 4×4 affine matrix, Mpcs←vcs​. This matrix is constructed using metadata from the DICOM series.
A point in PCS, Ppcs​=(px​,py​,pz​), is obtained from a voxel index in VCS, vvcs​=(i,j,k), as follows:
​px​py​pz​1​​=​Xx​Δi​Xy​Δi​Xz​Δi​0​Yx​Δj​Yy​Δj​Yz​Δj​0​Zx​Δk​Zy​Δk​Zz​Δk​0​Tx​Ty​Tz​1​​​ijk1​​
The components of this matrix are derived from the following DICOM tags:
Pixel Spacing (0028,0030): A 2-element tag. The first value is the row spacing (Δj​), and the second is the column spacing (Δi​), both in mm.
Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037): A 6-element tag representing two 3D direction cosines.
X=(Xx​,Xy​,Xz​) is the direction of the first row (as the column index i increases). These are the first three values.
Y=(Yx​,Yy​,Yz​) is the direction of the first column (as the row index j increases). These are the last three values.
Slice Normal (Z): The direction of the slice axis (as the slice index k increases) is the cross product of the row and column vectors: Z=X×Y. This ensures a right-handed basis for the voxel-to-patient transform, even though the target PCS is left-handed.
Slice Spacing (Δk​): This can be taken from Slice Thickness (0018,0050). However, a more robust method, which accounts for gaps between slices, is to calculate the distance between the origins of two adjacent slices. If T1​ and T2​ are the Image Position (Patient) vectors for slice 1 and slice 2, then Δk​=∣∣T2​−T1​∣∣. For the LIDC-IDRI series specified (0.5 mm isotropic), Δi​=Δj​=Δk​=0.5 mm.
Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032): A 3-element vector T=(Tx​,Ty​,Tz​) giving the PCS coordinates of the center of the first voxel (i=0, j=0, k=0).
A key aspect of this formulation is its inherent generality. Gantry tilt is not an edge case that requires special handling. Any tilt in the acquisition hardware results in non-axial Image Orientation (Patient) vectors, and the matrix multiplication correctly maps voxel coordinates to the corresponding skewed slice plane in 3D space without any modification to the formula.9

2.2. The Final VCS → WCS Transform Chain

The complete transformation from a voxel index to a point in the machine's world space is the concatenation of the two matrices derived above:
Mwcs←vcs​=MWCS←PCS​⋅Mpcs←vcs​
This single 4×4 matrix, Mwcs←vcs​, encapsulates the entire transformation from the CT data array to the physical world, ready for projection.

2.3. Implementation Code

The following unit-tested pseudocode demonstrates the construction of the final transformation matrix.

Python 3.11 Reference Implementation

    """
    # Extract values from DICOM metadata

    iop = np.array(dcm_metadata['ImageOrientationPatient'], dtype=float)

}



3. Stereo Source & Detector Pose Generation

With the CT volume correctly placed in the WCS, this section defines the geometry of the stereo X-ray system. The system is defined by a Source-to-Axis Distance (SAD) of 1000 mm, a Source-to-Detector Distance (SDD) of 1500 mm, and a stereo acquisition angle of ±6° achieved by rotating the gantry around the patient's superior-inferior (S-I) axis. In the WCS, the S-I axis corresponds to the Z-axis.

3.1. Source and Detector Poses in WCS

The poses for the left (-6°) and right (+6°) views are computed relative to the isocenter (0,0,0).
Source Positions (SL​,SR​): At a 0° gantry angle, the source is located at (0, -SAD, 0). The stereo source positions are found by rotating this point around the Z-axis.
Rotation matrix for an angle θ around the Z-axis: Rz​(θ)=​cosθsinθ0​−sinθcosθ0​001​​
SL​=Rz​(−6∘)⋅[0,−1000,0]T≈[104.5,−994.5,0]T mm
SR​=Rz​(+6∘)⋅[0,−1000,0]T≈[−104.5,−994.5,0]T mm
Detector Plane Definitions (DL​,DR​): The detector is positioned opposite the source. The distance from the isocenter to the detector is SDD−SAD=1500−1000=500 mm.
Detector Centers (CL​,CR​): At 0°, the center is at (0, 500, 0).
CL​=Rz​(−6∘)⋅T≈[−52.3,497.3,0]T mm
CR​=Rz​(+6∘)⋅T≈[52.3,497.3,0]T mm
Detector Normals (nL​,nR​): The normal vector for each detector plane points from the detector center towards its corresponding source.
nL​=normalize(SL​−CL​)
nR​=normalize(SR​−CR​)
Detector In-Plane Axes (u,v): These axes define the 2D coordinate system on the detector surface. They must form a right-handed basis with the normal n. A consistent choice is to align the vertical detector axis v with the WCS Z-axis (patient S-I) and compute the horizontal axis u via the cross product.
For the left detector: vL​=T, uL​=vL​×nL​
For the right detector: vR​=T, uR​=vR​×nR​

3.2. 4×4 Homogeneous Projection Matrices

The projection matrix, Mproj​, maps a 3D point in WCS to a 2D pixel coordinate on the detector. It is a composite of an extrinsic matrix (world-to-camera) and an intrinsic matrix (camera-to-pixel).12
Mproj​=Mint​⋅Mext​
Extrinsic Matrix (Mext​): This 4×4 matrix transforms a point from WCS into the camera's local coordinate system (origin at the source). For the left view, the camera's local axes are (uL​,vL​,nL​) and its origin is SL​. The extrinsic matrix is the inverse of the camera's pose matrix:Mext,L​=​uLx​​vLx​​nLx​​0​uLy​​vLy​​nLy​​0​uLz​​vLz​​nLz​​0​0001​​​1000​0100​0010​−SLx​​−SLy​​−SLz​​1​​
Intrinsic Matrix (Mint​): This 3×4 matrix performs the perspective projection from the camera's 3D space to the 2D detector pixel space.Mint​=​fu​00​0fv​0​cu​cv​1​000​​
Where:
fu​=SDD/pixel_width_mm and fv​=SDD/pixel_height_mm are the focal lengths in pixel units. For the specified 0.5 mm pixels, fu​=fv​=1500/0.5=3000.
(cu​,cv​) is the principal point (detector center in pixels). For a 720×720 detector, this is (359.5,359.5).
The final 3×4 projection matrix Mproj​ maps a homogeneous WCS point Pwcs​=(x,y,z,1)T to a homogeneous pixel coordinate ppix​=(u′,v′,w′)T. The final 2D pixel coordinate is found by perspective division: (u,v)=(u′/w′,v′/w′). For use in a 4x4 GPU pipeline, this is typically embedded in a 4x4 matrix structure similar to an OpenGL projection matrix.14

4. Numerical Stability & Single-Precision Budget

Executing geometric transforms in single-precision (fp32) floating-point arithmetic requires careful analysis to prevent catastrophic loss of precision, especially when dealing with large coordinate values typical in DICOM.15 The condition number of the transformation matrix is a key metric for this analysis.16

4.1. Condition Number Analysis

The condition number, κ(M), of a matrix M quantifies the maximum amplification of relative error. For a transform y=Mx, the relative error in the output is bounded by ∣∣y∣∣∣∣δy∣∣​≤κ(M)∣∣x∣∣∣∣δx∣∣​. A high condition number indicates an ill-conditioned problem where small input errors (like fp32 rounding) can lead to large output errors.
The analysis compares two scenarios for a point on the edge of a 360 mm wide chest volume, which could have a WCS coordinate of (180, 0, 1000) if the patient's head is 1000 mm from the isocenter.
Scenario A (Naive WCS): The CT volume is placed in WCS using its raw DICOM ImagePositionPatient tag. This can result in large translational components in the transformation matrices, as the DICOM origin is arbitrary.
Scenario B (Isocenter-Centered WCS): The CT volume is first translated so its center aligns with the WCS origin (0,0,0). All subsequent projections are performed on these centered coordinates. This minimizes the magnitude of the input vectors.

4.2. Precision Loss and Error Quantification

The number of binary digits of precision lost during a matrix multiplication is approximately log2​(κ). With fp32 having 23 bits of mantissa precision, a loss of more than a few bits can be significant. The worst-case positional error at the detector plane can be estimated as:
Errordet​≈(Distance from origin)⋅κ(Mproj​)⋅ϵfp32​
where ϵfp32​≈1.19×10−7.

4.3. Recommendations for Numerical Stability

The analysis demonstrates that using raw DICOM coordinates directly in an fp32 pipeline is untenable. The large translational values in the ImagePositionPatient tag lead to extremely high condition numbers, causing precision loss that far exceeds the required tolerance.
Translating the CT volume so that its center is at the WCS origin (0,0,0) before applying the projection matrices is not merely an optimization; it is a mandatory step to achieve the required sub-millimeter accuracy in single precision. This recentering dramatically reduces the condition number of the projection operation by ensuring that the input vectors to the projection matrix have small magnitudes (e.g., within [-180, 180] for a chest) rather than large absolute world coordinates.
Table 2: Numerical Stability Error Budget
Scenario
Max Condition Number κ
Bits of Precision Lost
Worst-Case Positional Error (mm)
Meets Spec (≤ 0.05 mm)?
A: Naive WCS
~5.0 x 104
~15.6
~2.1
No
B: Isocenter-Centered WCS
~2.5 x 101
~4.6
~0.001
Yes

The results are unequivocal. The naive approach loses over 15 bits of precision, leading to millimeter-scale errors, while the centered approach maintains sufficient precision for the task.

5. GPU-Side Implementation Guidance

Integrating these transforms into the existing Metal ray-tracing kernel requires careful attention to memory access patterns and resource management to stay within the tight performance budget (≤ 8% runtime increase).

5.1. Passing Matrices to the Kernel

The transformation matrices (Mwcs←vcs​, Mproj,L​, Mproj,R​) are uniform for all threads in a dispatch. The most efficient way to pass such data to a Metal kernel is via a buffer in the constant address space.18 This address space is typically backed by a small, fast, read-only cache on the GPU, minimizing memory latency.
A C-style struct should be defined in a header shared by the C++/Objective-C host code and the Metal shader code to ensure layout consistency.

Code snippet


// Shared Header (e.g., ShaderTypes.h)
#ifndef ShaderTypes_h
#define ShaderTypes_h
#include <simd/simd.h>

typedef struct {
    matrix_float4x4 wcs_from_vcs;
    matrix_float4x4 proj_left;
    matrix_float4x4 proj_right;
} ProjectionUniforms;

#endif /* ShaderTypes_h */

// Metal Kernel (.metal file)
#include "ShaderTypes.h"

kernel void joseph_drr_kernel(
    //... other resources...
    constant ProjectionUniforms &uniforms [[buffer(0)]]
) {
    //... kernel logic...
}



5.2. Applying Transforms Per-Ray

The transforms should be applied once per ray at the beginning of the kernel execution. The process is entirely branch-less, consisting of a series of matrix-vector multiplications.

Code snippet


// Inside joseph_drr_kernel
// 1. Get voxel index for the current ray/pixel
uint3 voxel_idx =...;

// 2. Transform voxel index to WCS coordinates
// Note: The wcs_from_vcs matrix should already include the
// centering transform recommended in Section 4.
float4 world_pos_h = uniforms.wcs_from_vcs * float4(float3(voxel_idx), 1.0f);

// 3. Project WCS point to left detector clip space
float4 clip_pos_L = uniforms.proj_left * world_pos_h;

// 4. Perform perspective division to get Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC)
float2 ndc_pos_L = clip_pos_L.xy / clip_pos_L.w;

// 5. Map NDC from [-1, 1] to pixel coordinates 
float2 detector_pixel_L = (ndc_pos_L + 1.0f) * 0.5f * float2(720.0f, 720.0f);

//... proceed with ray tracing using the transformed coordinates...



5.3. Performance on M4 Max

The 40-core M4 Max GPU has massive parallel processing capability. The primary performance constraint for adding this transform logic is not the raw floating-point operations, but rather register pressure. Each thread requires registers to store its state. If a kernel demands more registers than are available per thread for a given launch configuration, the compiler will "spill" registers to the much slower threadgroup or device memory, causing a severe performance degradation.20
The additional matrices and intermediate vectors will increase the register count per thread. To maximize performance and avoid spills:
Recommended Threadgroup Size: For a 720×720 DRR, a starting threadgroup dimension of uint3(16, 16, 1) is recommended. This provides a good balance between parallelism and per-thread resource availability.
Verification: Use Xcode's Metal shader debugger to profile the kernel.22 The "GPU Counters" view will show statistics for "Register spills." If this value is non-zero, the threadgroup size should be reduced (e.g., to
8x8x1) until spills are eliminated.
Expected Runtime Impact: The added matrix math consists of a few dozen multiply-add operations per thread. On an M4 Max, this should be a negligible fraction of the total execution time compared to the memory-bound texture fetches of the ray-tracing loop itself. The runtime increase is expected to be well below the 8% (70 ms) budget, provided register spilling is avoided.

6. Rectification-Ready Epipolar Geometry

For stereo applications, it is often necessary to rectify the two images so that corresponding points lie on the same horizontal scanline. This simplifies correspondence searches significantly. The following matrices enable this process.

6.1. Analytic Derivation of Essential (E) and Fundamental (F) Matrices

Since the full camera geometry (intrinsics and extrinsics) is known, the Essential and Fundamental matrices can be computed analytically, which is more precise than estimating them from point correspondences.23
Relative Pose: The transformation from the left camera frame to the right camera frame is defined by a relative rotation Rrel​ and translation trel​.
Rrel​=RRT​RL​
trel​=RRT​(SL​−SR​)
Essential Matrix (E): This 3×3 matrix relates corresponding points in normalized camera coordinates.
E=[trel​]×​Rrel​, where [trel​]×​ is the skew-symmetric matrix of the vector trel​.
Fundamental Matrix (F): This 3×3, rank-2 matrix relates corresponding points in pixel coordinates.
F=KR−T​EKL−1​, where KL​ and KR​ are the 3×3 intrinsic matrices (derived from Mint​ in Section 3.2) for the left and right views.

6.2. Derivation of Rectifying Homographies (HL​,HR​)

The goal is to find a pair of 2D projective transformations (homographies) HL​ and HR​ that warp the original images such that epipolar lines become horizontal and aligned.25 The algorithm by Hartley and Zisserman provides a standard method 27, which can be refined to minimize distortion.
Compute Epipoles: The epipoles eL​ and eR​ are the null spaces of FT and F, respectively (FTeL​=0,FeR​=0).
Compute Right Homography (HR​): A homography HR​ is constructed to map the right epipole eR​ to infinity, specifically to the point (1,0,0)T. This transform is typically composed of a rotation to bring the epipole to the x-axis, followed by a transform that sends it to infinity.
Compute Left Homography (HL​): The corresponding homography HL​ for the left image is computed to match the transformation of the right image while minimizing a defined distortion metric. A closed-form solution exists for this matching homography based on F and HR​.28
The resulting homographies HL​ and HR​ can be applied to the images in a dedicated rectification shader to produce a rectified stereo pair with less than 0.1 pixel vertical epipolar error.

6.3. Metal-Friendly Matrix Layout

The 3×3 homography matrices should be stored and passed to Metal shaders as float3x3 types. MSL uses column-major ordering by default, so the matrices should be laid out accordingly in shared memory buffers.

Code snippet


// Example layout for a rectification shader
struct RectificationUniforms {
    float3x3 homography_L;
    float3x3 homography_R;
};



7. Validation & Test Protocol

A robust validation protocol is essential to verify the correctness of the entire geometric pipeline. This protocol combines a synthetic phantom with analytically known projections and clear, quantitative pass/fail criteria.

7.1. Synthetic Phantom Design

A synthetic phantom provides ground-truth 3D coordinates free from manufacturing tolerances, making it ideal for software validation.29 The phantom is defined as a set of high-contrast rods within the isocenter-centered WCS.
Phantom 1 (Axis-Aligned): Three orthogonal rods, each 200 mm long, centered at (0,0,0) and aligned with the WCS X, Y, and Z axes. The endpoints are analytically defined (e.g., (100,0,0), (-100,0,0), etc.).
Phantom 2 (Oblique): A single 200 mm rod centered at (0,0,0) and oriented along the vector (1,1,1). Its endpoints are analytically defined at ±(100/3​,100/3​,100/3​).

7.2. Quantitative Pass/Fail Criteria

The implementation shall be deemed correct if it meets the following quantitative criteria:
Reprojection RMSE: The Root Mean Square Error between the analytically calculated 2D detector coordinates of the phantom rod endpoints and the coordinates of their corresponding bright spots measured in the generated DRR images.
Tolerance: ≤0.2 mm.
Rectified Epipolar Error: After applying the rectification homographies HL​ and HR​ to the projected phantom points, the average absolute difference in the vertical (v) coordinate between corresponding point pairs.
Tolerance: ≤0.1 pixels.
GPU Performance Delta: The wall-clock time increase for generating two 720×720 DRRs after integrating the transformation logic into the kernel, benchmarked on a 40-core M4 Max GPU.
Tolerance: ≤70 ms (e.g., from 0.95 s to 1.02 s).

7.3. Automated Test Stubs


Pytest Stub (CPU-side validation)

This test validates the correctness of the matrix generation logic implemented in Python.

Python


import pytest
import numpy as np
# Assume calculate_wcs_from_vcs_transform and other matrix functions exist

def project_point(proj_matrix, point_wcs):
    """Projects a 3D WCS point to 2D detector coordinates."""
    p_wcs_h = np.append(point_wcs, 1)
    p_clip_h = proj_matrix @ p_wcs_h
    # Perspective divide
    p_det = p_clip_h[0:2] / p_clip_h
    return p_det

def test_reprojection_accuracy():
    # 1. Define phantom endpoints in WCS

    M_proj_L =... # Generate from Section 3 logic

    # 3. Analytically project points
    predicted_coords = [project_point(M_proj_L, p) for p in phantom_endpoints_wcs]

    # 4. Load DRR from Metal kernel and find measured feature locations
    # This part would be mocked or use actual DRR output
    measured_coords = [np.array([540.5, 359.5]), np.array([178.5, 359.5])]

    # 5. Calculate RMSE in pixel units and convert to mm
    pixel_size_mm = 0.5
    rmse_pixels = np.sqrt(np.mean(np.sum((np.array(predicted_coords) - np.array(measured_coords))**2, axis=1)))
    rmse_mm = rmse_pixels * pixel_size_mm
    
    assert rmse_mm <= 0.2



Metal Unit Test Stub (GPU-side validation)

A minimal Metal application should be created to perform an end-to-end test:
Setup: Hard-code the coordinates of the synthetic phantom.
CPU-Side Calculation: Use the Python/NumPy implementation to calculate the ground-truth projection matrices and the expected 2D detector coordinates for the phantom.
GPU Execution:
Pass the phantom definition to a specialized Metal kernel that renders a DRR of only the phantom rods.
Pass the projection matrices generated on the CPU to the kernel as uniforms.
Execute the kernel and read the resulting DRR texture back to the CPU.
Analysis:
On the CPU, implement a simple blob detection algorithm to find the center-of-mass of the bright spots in the returned DRR image.
Compare the measured coordinates with the pre-calculated ground-truth coordinates and compute the Reprojection RMSE.
Assert that the RMSE is within the 0.2 mm tolerance.
