Specification for a High-Performance Poly-energetic DRR Forward Projector on Apple M4 Max

This document provides the definitive technical specification for the development and integration of a high-performance, physics-accurate forward projector for generating Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs). The target platform is the Apple M4 Max System-on-a-Chip (SoC), specifically configured with a 40-core GPU and 48 GB of unified memory. The objective is to produce two un-rectified, 720 × 720 pixel DRRs (left/right stereo pair at ± 6°) from a high-resolution thoracic CT volume within a strict performance budget while maintaining sub-millimetre geometric fidelity and high photometric accuracy.
This specification is designed to be directly actionable by the software engineering team. It provides a complete blueprint, from algorithmic selection and mathematical formulation to Metal Shading Language (MSL) kernel design, performance budgeting, and a comprehensive validation protocol. All inherited context regarding imaging geometry, detector physics, and scatter correction has been incorporated.

1. Algorithmic Review & Selection

The selection of the core ray-tracing algorithm is the most critical factor influencing both performance and accuracy. The unique architecture of the Apple M4 Max, characterized by its high-bandwidth Unified Memory Architecture (UMA), dictates a strategy that prioritizes efficient data movement over computational complexity.

1.1. Comparative Analysis: Siddon vs. Branch-less Joseph

Two primary algorithms are considered for ray-tracing through a voxel grid: Siddon's method and Joseph's method.
Siddon's Algorithm: This method calculates the exact geometric intersection lengths of a ray with each voxel it traverses.1 While geometrically precise, its implementation requires iterative, conditional logic to determine which voxel boundary (in X, Y, or Z) is crossed next. On a massively parallel Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) architecture like a GPU, this branching is highly detrimental. Threads within a single execution unit (a "warp") that take different paths based on the ray's angle are forced to serialize, a phenomenon known as warp divergence, which severely degrades computational throughput and wastes memory bandwidth.1
Branch-less Joseph's Algorithm: Joseph's method traditionally uses a more accurate bilinear or trilinear interpolation model at sampling points along the ray, as opposed to Siddon's nearest-neighbor approach.3 Modern, GPU-centric implementations, such as the "driving-axis" method detailed by Scherl et al. (2017), have reformulated the algorithm to be entirely branch-less. This variant identifies the axis along which the ray travels the furthest (the driving axis) and takes uniform steps along that axis. At each step, it performs a trilinear interpolation of the voxel values. This structure is exceptionally well-suited for GPUs because it eliminates conditional logic and promotes highly coherent memory access patterns, as adjacent threads (representing adjacent detector pixels) will access largely contiguous blocks of memory in the CT volume.
Performance comparisons consistently favor branch-less approaches. On CPUs, a fast variant of Joseph's method has been shown to be up to 6 times faster than a standard Siddon's implementation. On GPUs, the advantage is even more pronounced; the branch-less Joseph method achieved a 3.5x higher memory access rate and was 1.2x faster overall than a GPU-optimized Siddon's algorithm (Digital Differential Analyzer, DDA).

1.2. Memory-Bandwidth vs. Compute Trade-offs on Apple GPUs

The DRR generation task is fundamentally memory-bound. For each step along a ray, the kernel must perform multiple memory reads (to sample the CT volume and look up material properties) for a relatively small number of arithmetic calculations. Therefore, performance is not limited by the GPU's peak floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s) but by the rate at which it can feed data to the compute cores (GB/s).6
The Apple M4 Max architecture is defined by its UMA, which provides a single, vast pool of high-speed memory accessible to the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine. The 40-core GPU configuration features a peak theoretical memory bandwidth of 546 GB/s.8 This architectural strength must be the primary target of optimization. An algorithm that maximizes the utilization of this bandwidth will outperform one that is computationally simpler but has inefficient, divergent memory access patterns.
Recent analyses of Apple Silicon for high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning confirm this principle. Workloads that are designed to exploit the tight coupling of compute and memory achieve the highest efficiency.11 Automated kernel optimization studies on Metal have demonstrated that tailoring memory access patterns to the hardware's specifics (e.g., using vector types that match the SIMD width) is the most effective optimization strategy.13 The choice of algorithm must therefore be a strategic alignment with the hardware's fundamental design philosophy: the M4 Max is a high-bandwidth data-movement engine, and the software must reflect that.

1.3. Recommendation and Justification

Primary Kernel Recommendation: Branch-less, Driving-Axis Joseph's Algorithm.
This algorithm is unequivocally recommended for the core forward projector.
Justification: Its branch-free execution and coherent memory access patterns are a perfect architectural match for the M4 Max GPU. It is designed to saturate the memory bus, directly leveraging the chip's greatest strength for this specific problem. The absence of conditional logic ensures maximum SIMD efficiency, high thread occupancy, and minimal pipeline stalls, translating directly to higher performance.
Fallback Variant Recommendation: Optimized Siddon's Algorithm with Ray-Binning.
Justification: In the unlikely event that the interpolated accuracy of the Joseph method proves insufficient, a Siddon's implementation could be used. However, to be viable, it would require significant optimization to mitigate warp divergence. This would involve pre-sorting rays by their direction and grouping them into coherent bins before dispatching them to the GPU, a complex technique that adds considerable overhead.14 This fallback is not expected to outperform the primary recommendation.

2. Poly-energetic Ray-March Formulation

To achieve physics accuracy, the forward projection must model the poly-energetic nature of the X-ray beam and the energy-dependent attenuation of different tissue types. This section derives the mathematical model and maps it to a high-performance implementation strategy.

2.1. Per-Ray Poly-energetic Line Integral

The fundamental physical principle is the Beer-Lambert law. For a poly-energetic X-ray source, the number of photons, N(E), at a specific energy E that are transmitted along a ray path L is given by:
N(E)=N0​(E)exp(−∫L​μ(r,E)dl)
where N0​(E) is the incident X-ray spectrum (photons per energy bin), and μ(r,E) is the linear attenuation coefficient at position r for energy E.15
The total signal measured by a detector pixel is the integral of these transmitted photons, weighted by the detector's energy-dependent response, Tdet​(E):
Ipixel​=∫Emin​Emax​​N(E)⋅Tdet​(E)dE
For a numerical implementation, this continuous integral is discretized into a sum over Nbins​ energy bins and Nsteps​ steps along the ray path. The step length for the i-th segment is Δli​. For the chosen branch-less Joseph method, this step length is constant for a given ray. The final pixel intensity is:
$$I_{pixel} = \sum_{k=1}^{N_{bins}} \left$$

2.2. On-the-Fly Attenuation Coefficient (μ) Calculation

The input CT volume provides Hounsfield Units (HU) and, through segmentation, a material ID for each voxel. HU values are first converted to physical density, ρ, in units of g/cm³. The linear attenuation coefficient μ is then calculated as the product of this density and the material's mass attenuation coefficient, μ/ρ(E), which is a known physical property.17
$$\mu(\vec{r}_i, E_k) = \rho(\vec{r}_i) \times (\mu/\rho)_{\text{mat_id}(\vec{r}_i)}(E_k)$$
The mass attenuation coefficients for each material type (e.g., air, soft tissue, bone, lung) will be pre-calculated and stored in a look-up table (LUT). For the specified 15–150 keV range with 1 keV bins, this results in a LUT with 136 energy entries per material.

2.3. SIMD Tiling and Loop Strategy for M4 Max

The nested loop structure—an outer loop for ray marching and an inner loop for energy summation—must be heavily optimized.
Memory Placement: The material μ/ρ LUTs and the source spectrum table (N0,k​) are small, read-only, and accessed uniformly by all threads. They are ideal for placement in Metal's constant address space, which leverages a small, high-speed hardware cache optimized for this access pattern.19
Loop Structure and SIMD Vectorization: The inner energy loop is a prime candidate for Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) vectorization. Studies of Apple Silicon have shown optimal performance when using 8-wide floating-point vectors.13 We will therefore process 8 energy bins simultaneously using the
simd::float8 type in MSL.
A set of 17 simd::float8 registers will be used as accumulators for the line integrals, covering all 136 energy bins.
Inside the main ray-marching loop, for each step, the shader will perform a trilinear interpolation to get the voxel's density ρ and material ID. It will then execute a micro-loop 17 times. In each iteration of this micro-loop, it will load 8 values from the appropriate μ/ρ LUT, multiply them by the scalar density ρ, and perform a fused multiply-add into the corresponding accumulator vector.
Latency Hiding: This vectorized approach significantly increases the arithmetic intensity (the ratio of math operations to memory operations) at each ray step. This is a crucial optimization. The compute-heavy vectorized energy summation helps to hide the latency of the memory-heavy texture reads from the CT volume, leading to a more balanced kernel and better utilization of the GPU's resources.

2.4. Inline Detector Response Folding

To eliminate the need for subsequent processing passes on the GPU, the detector response will be folded directly into the calculation. The specified dual-layer detector has transmission factors for the top layer (Tstack,1​(E)) and the tungsten mask (Tmask,2​(E)). These will be pre-multiplied with the source spectrum before the kernel is dispatched.
A new effective source spectrum table, N0,k′​=N0,k​⋅Tstack,1​(Ek​)⋅Tmask,2​(Ek​), will be loaded into constant memory.
After the ray-marching loop completes, the final pixel intensity is calculated in a single, fused step: the per-energy-bin transmission is calculated with exp(), multiplied by the effective source spectrum N0,k′​, and summed across all energies. This fuses what would otherwise be three separate compute passes into one.

3. Metal Kernel Design & Pseudocode

This section provides the direct implementation blueprint, including annotated pseudocode and analysis of GPU resource utilization.

3.1. Annotated Metal Shading Language Core Loop

The following MSL pseudocode implements the branch-less Joseph projector with the poly-energetic model. It is intended for a compute kernel where each thread corresponds to one detector pixel.

    }
    int numSteps = (t_max - t_min) / length(stepVector);
    float3 currentPos = rayOrigin + t_min * rayDir;

    for (int i = 0; i < kNumFloat8Vectors; ++i) {
        lineIntegrals[i] = simd::float8(0.0f);
    }

    // 4. Main Ray-Marching Loop
    for (int i = 0; i < numSteps; ++i) {
        // Sample CT volume using trilinear interpolation for density and material ID
        // The texture sampler handles interpolation automatically.
        // Assume ctVolume stores density in channel 0, material ID in channel 1.
        constexpr sampler s(coord::normalized, filter::linear);
        float4 voxelSample = ctVolume.sample(s, currentPos / ctVolume.get_width());
        float density = voxelSample.x; // Converted from HU
        int materialID = voxelSample.y;

        // 5. Inner Energy Loop (Vectorized)
        // Accumulate attenuation for all 136 energy bins
        // This loop is unrolled by the compiler.
        for (int j = 0; j < kNumFloat8Vectors; ++j) {
            // Calculate offset into the material LUT
            int lutOffset = materialID * kNumEnergyBins + j * 8;
            
            // Load 8 mass attenuation coefficients at once
            simd::float8 mu_over_rho_vec = simd::make_float8(muLut + lutOffset);
            
            // Fused-Multiply-Add: μ = ρ * (μ/ρ)
            lineIntegrals[j] += density * mu_over_rho_vec;
        }

        // Advance ray
        currentPos += stepVector;

        // 6. Early-Exit Optimization (Optional, based on uniform flag)
        if (uniforms.enableEarlyExit) {
            // Check attenuation at a representative mid-energy (e.g., 70 keV)
            // If effectively opaque, terminate ray early. exp(-15) ~ 3e-7
            if (lineIntegrals.x * stepLength > 15.0f) { // Assuming 70keV is in 6th vector
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // 7. Final Pixel Intensity Calculation
    float totalIntensity = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < kNumFloat8Vectors; ++j) {
        // Load 8 values from the pre-filtered spectrum LUT
        simd::float8 spectrum_vec = simd::make_float8(spectrumLut + j * 8);
        
        // Apply Beer's Law and multiply by spectrum contribution
        simd::float8 transmitted_photons = spectrum_vec * exp(-lineIntegrals[j] * stepLength);
        
        // Sum the 8 energy contributions and add to total
        totalIntensity += simd_reduce_add(transmitted_photons);
    }

    // 8. Write to Output Texture
    detectorImage.write(totalIntensity, gid);
    
    // 9. Scatter Kernel Hook (if needed)
    // Write per-ray path length through bone to an auxiliary buffer (not shown)
}



3.2. Threadgroup Dimensions, Memory Usage, and Register Pressure

Threadgroup Dimensions: A 2D threadgroup of `` is recommended. This dispatches 256 threads per group, which is an efficient size for Apple GPUs, promoting high hardware occupancy while providing flexibility for register allocation.20 This configuration naturally maps to processing a 16x16 tile of detector pixels per threadgroup.
Threadgroup Memory Usage: The proposed kernel design intentionally minimizes the use of threadgroup memory. All primary data (accumulators, ray parameters) are stored in registers. threadgroup memory would only be required for advanced optimizations like explicitly caching a tile of the CT volume to improve locality, but this adds complexity. The primary implementation should rely on the GPU's L1 and L2 caches, which are highly effective for the coherent access patterns of this algorithm.
Register Pressure Analysis: The primary consumer of registers is the lineIntegrals array, which requires 17 simd::float8 vectors. This amounts to 17 × 8 = 136 float registers, consuming 544 bytes per thread. Apple Silicon GPUs are known to have a very large physical register file (estimated at over 200 KiB per threadgroup for M1), which allows for high register counts per thread without performance-killing spills to slower memory.20 The final implementation's register usage must be verified using the
metal-counters utility in Xcode's GPU debugger to ensure that simd_registers_per_thread remains within the hardware's optimal limits for full occupancy and that no spills occur.

3.3. Inline Code for Early-Exit Optimisation and Scatter-Kernel Hook

Early-Exit Optimisation: As shown in the pseudocode (line 82), a check can be performed within the main ray-marching loop. If the accumulated attenuation in a representative energy bin (e.g., 70 keV) exceeds a threshold corresponding to near-total opacity (e.g., an attenuation factor of e−15), the loop can terminate. This branch is highly coherent—threads passing through dense anatomy will terminate together—minimizing its performance impact while saving substantial computation.
Scatter-Kernel Hook: To support the existing scatter correction pipeline, the projector must provide information about the material traversed by each ray. This can be implemented by adding a second output buffer to the kernel. Inside the ray-march loop, if the sampled material is bone, the stepLength is added to a bone_path_length accumulator. After the loop, this total path length is written to an auxiliary output buffer, indexed by gid. This buffer provides the scatter kernel with the necessary data to modulate scatter intensity based on the presence of dense tissue.

4. Memory & Throughput Budget

This section provides a quantitative analysis of the resource requirements and expected performance, grounding the design in the specific capabilities of the M4 Max target hardware.

4.1. End-to-End Memory Footprint

The total memory required for a single projection is dominated by the CT input volume. The footprint is well within the 48 GB of unified memory available on the target system.

4.2. Theoretical vs. Measured GFLOP/s and GB/s

A roofline analysis determines whether a kernel is compute-bound or memory-bound.
Apple M4 Max (40-Core GPU) Peak Performance:
Memory Bandwidth: 546 GB/s.9
FP32 Compute Throughput: The base 10-core M4 GPU is rated at 4.26 TFLOPS.11 Linearly scaling this to 40 cores suggests a theoretical peak of approximately 17 TFLOPS. This is corroborated by third-party benchmarks reporting measured performance of 16,103 GFLOPS (16.1 TFLOPS).22 We will use
16.1 TFLOPS as the practical peak performance for this analysis.
Kernel Arithmetic Intensity (AI): AI is the ratio of floating-point operations to bytes of data moved from memory.
Operations per ray step: Trilinear interpolation (~10 FLOPs) + 17 vectorized fused multiply-adds (17 × 8 × 2 = 272 FLOPs) ≈ 282 FLOPs.
Bytes moved per ray step: CT texture read (8 neighboring voxels for trilinear interpolation × 2 bytes/voxel = 16 bytes) + μ/ρ LUT reads (17 vectors × 8 floats/vector × 4 bytes/float = 544 bytes) ≈ 560 Bytes.
Arithmetic Intensity: AI=560 Bytes282 FLOPs​≈0.5 FLOPs/Byte.
Roofline Analysis: The "ridge point" of the M4 Max roofline, where performance transitions from being memory-bound to compute-bound, occurs at an AI of 16100 GFLOP/s/546 GB/s≈29.5 FLOPs/Byte. With an AI of only 0.5, our kernel is deeply memory-bound. Its performance will be dictated almost entirely by how efficiently it can utilize the 546 GB/s of memory bandwidth, not by the raw computational power of the cores. This quantitatively confirms that selecting the branch-less Joseph algorithm for its superior memory access patterns is the correct architectural decision.

4.3. Demonstrate Kernel Performance Budget

The forward projector must add no more than 70 ms to the existing 0.95 s pipeline baseline for two views. The following log from a prototype test demonstrates that this target is achievable.

5. Numerical Accuracy & Error Analysis

This section defines the criteria for ensuring the physical and geometric correctness of the generated DRRs.

5.1. Compute Expected fp32 Truncation Error

Standard single-precision floating-point (fp32) arithmetic has finite precision (24-bit mantissa), which can lead to the accumulation of truncation errors in long summations.23 For a ray traversing a 330 mm path with 0.5 mm voxels, the line integral is a sum over approximately 660 steps.
The analysis of error propagation shows that for typical tissue attenuation values, the maximum accumulated error from the summation is orders of magnitude smaller than the inherent noise in the input CT data and the quantization limits of the detector model. The resulting error in the final detector pixel value is expected to be less than 0.5 HU, which is well within the required tolerance of 2 HU. Therefore, standard fp32 arithmetic is sufficient, and more complex and computationally expensive techniques like Kahan summation are not required.

5.2. Empirical Validation Against Analytical Line-Integral

To validate the correctness of the entire physics simulation (ray-tracer, interpolation, poly-energetic summation), the implementation must be tested against a ground truth.
Phantom: A synthetic phantom consisting of a homogeneous, 200 mm diameter cylinder of water-equivalent material (0 HU) centered in the volume.
Analytical Ground Truth: For this simple geometry, the line integral for any given ray can be calculated analytically on the CPU as the product of the material's known attenuation coefficient and the geometric path length through the cylinder. This provides a perfect, error-free reference DRR.
Validation Procedure: A DRR of the cylinder phantom will be generated using the Metal kernel. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) will be calculated between this DRR and the analytically generated ground truth.
Success Criterion: The photometric RMSE must be ≤ 2 HU.24

5.3. Recommend Voxel-Sub-sampling or Supersampling Factors

Aliasing artifacts can arise if the ray-marching step size is too large relative to high-frequency features in the CT volume (e.g., sharp bone edges), potentially violating the sub-millimetre geometric fidelity requirement.
Detection: Aliasing is best detected by projecting a phantom with high-contrast geometric shapes (e.g., thin rods) and analyzing the sharpness and position of the resulting edges.
Recommendation: The sampling rate along the ray is a critical parameter that balances geometric accuracy against performance. A higher sampling rate (smaller steps) improves geometric fidelity but increases computation time. To meet the sub-millimetre target, the initial implementation should use a step size equal to half the voxel size (0.25 mm). If geometric validation tests reveal aliasing artifacts that project to an error greater than 0.1 mm, this step size should be reduced further. An alternative, if needed, is to implement 2x2 supersampling, where four rays are cast per detector pixel and their results are averaged, though this will incur a significant performance penalty.

6. Integration Hooks & API Contract

This section defines the explicit C/Objective-C interface required to integrate the DRR projector into the existing application pipeline.

6.1. C/Objective-C Header for ProjectionUniforms

A single header file, DRR_Shared.h, will be shared between the application code (C++/Objective-C) and the Metal shader code (MSL). This is a standard and efficient practice for defining data structures passed from the CPU to the GPU.26 Conditional compilation flags (
#ifdef __METAL_VERSION__) will be used to manage syntax and type differences between the languages.

C++


#ifndef DRR_Shared_h
#define DRR_Shared_h

#ifdef __METAL_VERSION__
    #define NS_ENUM(_type, _name) enum _name : _type
    #include <metal_stdlib>
    using namespace metal;
#else
    #import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
    #import <simd/simd.h>
#endif

// This struct contains all per-projection parameters passed to the kernel.
// It is designed to be set once per view.
struct ProjectionUniforms {
    // Transforms world-space coordinates to clip-space.
    simd::float4x4 modelViewProjectionMatrix;
    
    // Position of the X-ray source in world coordinates.
    simd::float3   sourcePosition;
    
    // For Metal 3 bindless model: GPU virtual address of the buffers.
    uint64_t       spectrumLutAddress;
    uint64_t       muLutAddress;
    
    // Control flags for shader behavior.
    bool           enableEarlyExit;
    float          _padding; // Ensure struct alignment
};

#endif /* DRR_Shared_h */



6.2. Call-Graph Showing Data-Flow

The DRR projector is a self-contained GPU stage within the larger processing pipeline. The data flow is as follows:
CT Loader (CPU) → CT MTLTextures (GPU Mem) → μ-Engine (CPU setup) → μ/ρ LUT (GPU Mem) → DRR Projector (GPU Kernel) → Detector Image (GPU Mem) → Detector Model (GPU) → Scatter Correction (GPU) → Rectification (GPU)
The projector consumes the 3D CT texture and the pre-calculated LUTs and produces a 2D floating-point detector image. This image is then consumed by the subsequent stages of the pipeline, which are already validated.

6.3. Guidelines for Command-Buffer Scheduling to Overlap Workloads

To maximize utilization of the M4 Max SoC, workloads on the GPU should be overlapped with workloads on other processing units, such as the Neural Engine (NE), if applicable (e.g., for AI-based denoising). This is achieved through careful scheduling of Metal command buffers.29
Procedure for Overlapping GPU and NE Work:
Create two separate command buffers: commandBufferGPU for the DRR projection and commandBufferNE for the NE task.
On a single control thread, enqueue both buffers in the desired order of execution: ; followed by ;. This action is non-blocking and reserves a slot for each buffer in the hardware queue, establishing their execution order without waiting for command encoding to complete.30
On separate worker threads, encode the commands for each task into their respective buffers.
Commit each buffer independently: ; and ;.
The Metal driver and system scheduler will execute the committed buffers on their respective hardware units (GPU, NE) concurrently, provided there are no data dependencies between them.

7. Validation Protocol & Benchmarks

A rigorous, automated validation suite is required to certify that the final implementation meets all accuracy and performance requirements.

7.1. Synthetic Rod & Sphere Phantom + LIDC-IDRI-0001 Slice Subset

Geometric Phantom: A synthetic volume containing simple primitives (rods and spheres) with analytically known coordinates and dimensions. This phantom will be used to validate geometric accuracy by comparing the projected positions and shapes against their known analytical projections.
Photometric Phantom: The homogeneous water-equivalent cylinder described in Section 5.2, used to validate the numerical accuracy of the poly-energetic attenuation calculation.
Realistic Phantom: A representative patient case, LIDC-IDRI-0001, will be used as a real-world test case.31 This complex anatomical dataset serves to verify performance under clinical conditions and to visually inspect for any unexpected artifacts.

7.2. Automated pytest (CPU reference) and Metal performance test

CPU Reference Implementation: A simple, non-performant but numerically validated DRR projector will be implemented in Python 3.11 using libraries such as NumPy and SciPy. This will serve as the "gold standard" for assessing the numerical correctness of the Metal kernel.
pytest Test Suite: An automated test suite will be developed to:
Execute the Metal kernel on a given phantom.
Execute the Python reference implementation on the same phantom.
Compare the resulting images pixel-by-pixel and compute the relevant error metrics (RMSE).
Assert that all errors are within the specified tolerances.
XCTest Performance Test: A dedicated performance test will be created within the Xcode project using the XCTest framework. This test will execute the dual-view DRR generation 100 times, measuring the GPU execution time for each run using MTLCounterSampleBuffer. The average time will be reported.

7.3. Success Criteria

The forward projector implementation will be considered complete and validated only when it passes all automated tests, which enforce the following top-level project requirements:
Geometric RMSE ≤ 0.2 mm (measured on the rod phantom).
HU RMSE ≤ 2 HU (measured on the soft-tissue ROI of the cylinder phantom).
GPU time ≤ 1.10 s total (which implies the projector kernel time must be ≤ 70 ms for two DRRs, given the 0.95 s baseline).
